# ECSE-223-Brick-Breaker
Semester long group project. The class was mainly focused on model-oriented programming with Umple.

# Programming languages
* Java (backend)
* Java Swing (front-end)
* Umple, domain model

# Biggest Challenges
* Getting github working properly early. We would often erase each other's code because we worked on the same branch. Also, we did not pull before coding to get the latest changes so we would create merge conflicts later on.
* Manage time efficiently while respecting eacher other's deadline. For instance, a part of the program requires another part to be completed by another team member.
* We had a lot of difficulty structuring our UI into a user-friendly manner.

# What I've learned
* Git/Github
* Communicating with team efficiently
* Class and sequence diagram
* UML
* How to structure a proper MVC project
* Debugging efficiently
